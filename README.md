# Notes

You're definitely not stupid! Everyone starts somewhere, and the fact that you're preparing to present regular expressions (regex) means you're already on the right path. If you're starting from zero, breaking down the learning process into manageable steps and multiple sessions will help you build your knowledge while giving you time to practice.

Here’s a simple approach for how you can manage this:

### 1. **Start Small and Learn Gradually**
   Break the material into small, digestible chunks. Learn one concept, practice it, and then move to the next. You don’t need to know everything at once. 

   **Session Plan:**
   - **Session 1**: Introduction to Regular Expressions and Basic Syntax
   - **Session 2**: Character Classes and Anchors
   - **Session 3**: Quantifiers and Grouping
   - **Session 4**: Hands-on Examples and Real-life Use Cases

### 2. **Preparation for Questions
